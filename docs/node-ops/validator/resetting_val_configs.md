# Recreate all configs

Existing validators can refresh their configs by using the same `onboard` tool that new validators would use.

Ideally you will start from a fresh new user (not root) on your host.

Backup your config files in your current user's `~/.0L`.

### Re-onboard to create new configs

WARNING: This is destructive! When in doubt: `make backup`.

Make sure you have an `autopay_batch.json` in the `~/.0L` before continuing

```
make reset
```

alternatively:

```
onboard val --skip-mining --upstream-peer http://ip-address
```

This command will prompt for a few configs, including what directory you will be storing configs for that account. It will also prompt for the IP address of the node.

`--upstream-peer` fetches up-to-date epoch and waypoint information from an upstream.
`--from-source` indicates that you want to include paths to source in 0L.config, useful for development and oracle upgrade transaction for standard library.

`Fun statement` is not required, but you may want to enter the original one for consistency.
