# How to Configure Web Monitor Account Dictionary

## Why

You may be interested to identify account addresses displayed in the web monitor.

Web monitor supports a dictionary file to associate a note to every account address of your interest.

## How

Create a file named `accounts-dictionary.json` with the following structure example:

```
{
    "accounts": [
       { "note": "build a chain", "address": "88E74DFED34420F2AD8032148280A84B" },
       { "note": "save the world", "address": "4C613C2F4B1E67CA8D98A542EE3F59F5" }
    ]
}
```

## Where

The dictionary file must be placed in the validator /.0L folder. E.g.: `$HOME/.0L/accounts-dictionary.json`

Once the file is deployed, the server will send the notes to the client.
