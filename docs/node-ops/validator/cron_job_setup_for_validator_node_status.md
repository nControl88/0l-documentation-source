# Cronjob setup for validator node status

**This document will guide in setting up a cron job on your validator node. The cron job will email you the status of node every day around 6:30pm ET.**

## We using below tools for this guide:

1. Postfix email server
2. Tmux sessions for nodes
3. Script that takes a screenshot for tmux session
4. Cron job for sending email at regular intervals

## Postfix email server

Get your ubuntu version using the following command `lsb_release -a`

Find instructions specific to the ubuntu version to install postfix.

Here is one for `ubuntu 20.04` : https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-configure-postfix-on-ubuntu-20-04

Work through Step 2 in the above link.

After step 2, install mailutils using below command.

`sudo apt install mailutils`

Time to test:
echo "This email confirms that Postfix is working" | mail -s "Testing Posfix" test@utoronto.ca

In case you would like to send email to gmail. Instructions here:https://askubuntu.com/questions/1112772/send-system-mail-ubuntu-18-04

#### Note: These steps wont work for sending email to gmail. Additional steps might be needed. Request anyone able to set that up to update this document.

## Tmux sessions for nodes

Setup Tmux session for all the commands ex: running tower, tailing logs and viewing explorer.

Tmux should be installed in your linux machine already.

Start session: `tmux`

Split tab vertically: `ctrl + b + %` (3 tabs for each of the above tasks)

## Script for taking screenshot

Create a script file lets say `status.sh`:

```
 #!/bin/bash
 tmux capture-pane -J -p -t 0 > node.txt
 tmux capture-pane -J -p -t 1 > tower.txt
 tmux capture-pane -J -p -t 2 > explorer.txt
 echo "Status today" | mail -s "Node Status" mail@utoronto.ca -A ~/node.txt -A ~/tower.txt -A ~/explorer.txt
```

Save and exit.

## Cron job for sending email

Enter crontab: `sudo nano /etc/crontab`

Add the following link: `30 22 * * * root /usr/bin/sh ~/status.sh`
